1. Adaptive has flexible margins and widths while responsive and alter the structure of the page with different breakpoints.

2.Mobile first is designed for phones at low pixel widths and uses min width breakpoints to increase responsiveness to longer width devices.

3.because 62.5% of 16px (typical default browser font-size) is 10px, so setting font-size to 1 rem would be make it 10px.

4.It's an awesome way to write the styling files, so you can write the elements that are inside elements actually inside the elements by keeping them inside the curly brackets also called nesting, and the compiler changes the code into standard CSS which has its elements specified separately.

5.I enjoy the file structure and nesting capability; however, the separation of certain things threw me off at first, with practice I will get better and with larger projects I will be much more appreciative.
